# Drowsiness-detection-using-facial-landmark

Drowsiness has become one of the prominent reasons for accidents in the world.So here we have come up with a project which detects wheather a person is drowsy or not and the same will be installed in the front of the driverâ€™s seat which will be continously monitoring the face of the driver in order to detect drowsiness while driving. Since the camera is installed infront of driver, if he is drowsy or sleepy, by the rate of movement or the blink of the eyes using an algorithm, the software detects if he is drowsy and alarms him to take some rest.
